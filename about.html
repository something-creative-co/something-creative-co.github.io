            <p>We are Something: an event company founded by three queer female creatives who work with local artists and  entertainers to produce immersive experiences for our community. We support Toronto's multidisciplinary artists by providing them with opportunities to showcase their unique talents.</p>
            <p>When it comes to planning your next event, we  have the creative firepower to turn any gathering into Something extraordinary. Our goal is to come up with big ideas that will delight guests and leave them talking about a Something event long after they've gone home.</p>
